# Pezzawinkle's Angels Extension Mods for Factorio.

## Angel's Extended Smelting and Compression
A special thanks to [p.o.d](https://mods.factorio.com/user/p.o.d) for the original concept and backbone of the earlier versions of this mod. Other thanks go to [Arch666Angel](https://mods.factorio.com/user/Arch666Angel) for the awesome series of mods for which this expands. And a special thanks to anyone whose name ends up in the changelog for patches, bug reports and contributing to making this mod get to the point it currently is.
- I. Requires at a minimum angels smelting, as this uses angels buildings and recipe categories
- II. Fully functional with bobs plates, bobs logistics (pipes), and angels industries (components mode)
- III. Adds alternative smelting recipes to "bypass" intermediate steps such as:
    - III.I. Pipes and underground pipes, castable from molten metals (and some powder metallurgy)
    - III.II. Intermediate items such as gears can be cast from molten metals
    - III.III. Intermediate items such as gears can be cast with the coolant method for higher productivity
    - III.IV. The coolant variant for intermediates uses a preliminary version of casting plates for the gear recipes, similar to the angels industries version for engines
- IV. Adds more metal compression recipes
    - IV.I. Metal coils either hidden, or new based on alloys and plates
    - IV.II. Wire coils (based on copper and tin wire recipes)
    - IV.III. Allows productivity modules use in all uncoiling recipes
- V. SETTINGS:
    - V.I. Use tinted coil colourings, this uses a tinting scale for each coil (rather matte finish) which looks relatively consistent with the basic plates, otherwise uses angels or a custom version if angels does not exist.
- VI. Organises alloys into separate groups in the smelting tab
- VII. The code base has since been made more dynamic and is quite flexible than its original incarnation:
    - VII.I. attributes for automation can be found in prototypes/data-tables
    - VII.II. Extensively uses angels library and trigger systems for functionality
      (This was to allow for the use of the mod to work without bobs mods in the 0.18 updates)
- VIII. FUTURE AND POSSIBLE FEATURES:
    - VIII.I. Additional alloys from molten blending (the basis is there, but very badly balanced)
    - VIII.II. Addition of ball bearing casting (even though these are traditionally milled)
    - VIII.III. Modified smelting recipes to create less "samey" recipes
### FOR OTHER MOD COMPATIBILITY
    - Please ask on discord, please note that any compatibility should already exist between that mod, and angels smelting as a minimum.


## Petrochem Plus Redux (PCP REDUX)
A special thanks to [kinnom](https://mods.factorio.com/user/kinnom) for the original concept and backbone of the earlier versions of this mod. Other thanks go to [Arch666Angel](https://mods.factorio.com/user/Arch666Angel) for the awesome series of mods for which this expands.

- I. Requires at a minimum angels petrochem, as this uses angels buildings and recipe categories
- II. Fully functional with bobs plates, and full angels
- III. Partial support for APM, Pyanodons and some other mods
- III. Adds 4 new petrochem plastic recipes:
    - III.I. PolyCarbonate (PC): Synthesis works well with glass production
    - III.II. PolyMethylMethAcrylate (PMMA): Synergize with angels petrochem plastic 3 recipe
    - III.III. PolyVinylChloride (PVC): Synergizes with angels petrochem 2 and uses some less used chlorine themed recipes
    - III.IV. Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene (ABS): This is a new top tier plastic. This is a slightly more complex recipe than the top tier rubber recipe in angels, and was designed as an added incentive for its use.
- IV. Adds a new bioprocessing plastic recipe if angels bioprocessing is active:
    - IV.I. PolyLactic Acid (PLA): Uses a bacterial fermentation (as opposed to yeast) to produce a different acid, which is a pre-cursor to PLA.
- V. Adds 2 new glass recipes (alternative final curing path to their plasic paths)
    - V.I. PC: A common and known synthetic glass replacement material
    - V.II. PMMA: A less common, but known synthetic glass replacement material
- VI. Resin and Rubber changes:
    - VI.I. increases the challenge of the simplified highly productive bobs resin/styrene method
    -VI.II. Adds in Neoprene processing and rubber curing/processing into pellets and usable rubber. Contains many steps, but is highly productive.
- VII. A new catalyst (Cyan)
    -VII.I. used in exclusively advanced PCP recipes
- VIII. Many of the orignal concept recipes were moved into the base angels petrochem mod.
These include:
    - Water-gas shift and reverse water gas shift reactions (CO<-->CO2 processes)
    - Phosgene synthesis
    - Bisphenol-A production
